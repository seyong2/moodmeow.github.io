## Information We Collect

While using our App, in order to provide features of our app, we may collect, with your prior permission:

- Pictures and other information from your device's camera and photo library

We use this information to provide features of our service. The information is processed locally on your device by our predictive model and is not stored or shared.

You can enable or disable access to this information at any time, through your device settings.

## Data Retention Policy

### Data Security

We take appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## Children's Privacy

Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for the information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches (e.g., a zero-day attack targeting mobile operating systems).
